# Erlang Elixir

I bought the book "Introducing Elixir - Getting started in functional programming" by Simon St. Laurent and J. David Eisenberg which is published by O'Reilly.

Erlang is currently at version 18.3 and is released under the Apache License 2.0.  Erlang was originally developed by Ericsson Stockholm.

Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, BEAM.

The best place to start learning Elixir is by using the command line interface, Interactice Elixir or iex.
